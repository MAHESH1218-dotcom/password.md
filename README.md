A **password manager** is a software application designed to securely store, generate, and manage your passwords. It helps users maintain strong, unique passwords for each account without needing to remember them all. Password managers encrypt your credentials using strong encryption algorithms, ensuring they are safe from unauthorized access. They often include features like autofill for login forms, password strength analysis, and cross-platform synchronization. By using a password manager, users can enhance security and reduce the risks of password reuse or weak passwords.
